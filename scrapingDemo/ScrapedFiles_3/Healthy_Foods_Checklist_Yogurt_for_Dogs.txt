While most dog foods on the market don’t contain yogurt, the yummy dairy product may provide some nutritional benefits for your dog as a meal additive.
Plain, low or non-fat yogurt provides probiotic benefits and serves as an excellent source of calcium for our canine companions. Adding a small spoonful of yogurt to your dog’s regular kibble at mealtime can provide digestive benefits and even help your dog stay full longer.
If you decide to feed yogurt to your dog, make sure to read ingredient labels carefully. Avoid flavored yogurts that are packed with sugar, and never feed yogurt that contains the ingredient xylitol, an artificial sweetener that is toxic for dogs. It’s also important to avoid yogurt that is chocolate flavored, since chocolate is also poisonous to dogs.
Before making yogurt a regular part of your dog’s diet, consult your veterinarian to ensure proper serving suggestions.
Some dogs have a harder time digesting dairy products, so keep an eye out for any signs of lactose intolerance. These may include diarrhea, gas, and vomiting. If your dog displays any of these symptoms following yogurt consumption, follow up with your veterinarian.
