Dogs need protein to build, heal, and maintain body tissues and to protect and regulate body process. Lamb is a great protein option for canines and the ingredient is popping up in many pet-food options.
Lamb is packed with essential amino acids and is a good source of dietary fats, which help sustain energy. The red meat also offers up plenty of vitamins and minerals that support muscle development and encourage optimum skin and coat health in dogs.
Some pet food formulas will also use lamb meal, a rendered version of the meat that contains less water content. Lamb meal is often higher in protein than fresh lamb meat.
Lamb may be a better option for dogs who suffer from food sensitivities or food allergies caused by other protein sources such as beef or chicken. Check with your veterinarian to see if switching your dog to a lamb-based diet is the right choice.
