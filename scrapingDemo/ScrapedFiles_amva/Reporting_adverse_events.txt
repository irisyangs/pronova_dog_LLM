Adverse events are undesirable animal health occurrences during or after the use of a product or device, and such may or may not be caused by the product or device. Adverse events are rare and the majority of them are minor, but some can be life-threatening.
If you suspect that one of your animals is experiencing an adverse event, call your veterinarian or local veterinary emergency clinic immediately. Addressing your animalâ€™s health needs is the highest priority; reporting the adverse event can be done afterwards.
