 
Canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC), more familiarly known as "kennel cough," is a highly contagious illness affecting the respiratory tract in dogs. All breeds and ages are susceptible. As the name "kennel cough" suggests, dogs at particular risk are those exposed to settings where multiple dogs are typically gathered or housed, such as kennels, shelters, and daycare facilities.
Several different types of bacteria and viruses can contribute to CIRDC, and dogs can be infected by two or more of these organisms at the same time. A few of the more commonly involved organisms include Bordetella bronchiseptica (a bacterium) as well as canine parainfluenza virus and canine adenovirus type 2.

The classic sign of CIRDC is a frequent, honking cough that comes on suddenly. This cough has also been described as gagging or retching, and it can involve froth that looks like vomit. Coughing generally worsens with activity or exercise, which can irritate the airways.
Even so, not all dogs with CIRDC will have a cough. Other common signs include sneezing and a runny nose or eyes.
In most cases of CIRDC, the illness is mild and dogs fully recover within 7 to 10 days. However, depending on the infecting organism(s) and the dog's ability to fight them, some dogs may develop more severe signs like lethargy, decreased appetite, fever, productive cough, and rapid or labored breathing, which can signal that bacteria have infected the lungs (bacterial pneumonia) and immediate veterinary attention is needed.
Dogs in which canine distemper virus is one of the infecting organisms may also have gastrointestinal signs (e.g., vomiting or diarrhea), hardened footpads, and, as the disease progresses, neurologic signs (e.g., head tilt or circling behavior). These dogs, as well as puppies and older dogs with other health problems, are at greater risk of severe disease, and even death.
Most dogs with CIRDC are contagious before they start showing signs. Because of this, the disease can be difficult to control. It can spread rapidly, leading to outbreaks—particularly in multiple-dog settings. Some CIRDC-associated organisms are also quite hardy, able to survive in the environment for weeks, making controlling spread of infection even more challenging.
Dogs can catch CIRDC through close or direct contact (e.g., licking or nuzzling) with infected dogs, breathing in cough or sneeze droplets from infected dogs, and exposure to droplet-contaminated items such as toys, bedding, people's hands, or water bowls. The risk of infection is especially high when dogs are in close contact with other infected dogs for long periods of time.
If you suspect your dog has CIRDC, it is important to stop the disease from spreading by keeping the dog away from other dogs until fully recovered.
Can cats become infected too?
Yes, some of the CIRDC-associated bacteria/viruses (e.g., Bordetella bronchiseptica, Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus, and canine influenza virus) can infect and cause illness in cats.
Do infected dogs need to avoid people too?
Not usually. Only one CIRDC-associated organism—Bordetella bronchiseptica—is known to infect people, and cases of dog-to-human transmission are extremely rare. Most reported cases have been in severely immunocompromised people.
The first step to diagnosis is a visit to the veterinarian. If you suspect your dog might have CIRDC, it's a good idea to first call your veterinary clinic—before taking your dog in to be seen—and describe any signs you've noticed. Veterinary staff will recommend next steps to help your dog get the attention he or she needs, without infecting other patients.
Most dogs with mild CIRDC will improve fairly quickly, so there's no need for diagnostic tests in those cases. Instead, your veterinarian will make a "presumptive" diagnosis of CIRDC by thoroughly examining your dog for signs of illness, ruling out other causes of cough, and asking questions about exposure to other dogs or multiple-dog settings. Your veterinarian may also know about other cases of CIRDC in the area, which can strengthen suspicions.
On the other hand, testing is recommended when multiple dogs are affected (as in outbreaks), or if your dog seems to be getting worse despite supportive treatment. In those cases, your veterinarian will collect swab samples from the throat, nose, and/or edges of the eyes and submit those samples for lab testing to confirm infection and identify the specific bacteria/viruses involved. Less commonly, blood tests may be recommended.
There is no special drug for dogs with CIRDC. The treatment approach depends on how sick the dog is. Most mildly affected dogs will quickly make a full recovery with basic supportive care aimed at avoiding situations that promote coughing and irritate airways. This means encouraging the dog to rest and avoiding excitement and neck leashes. Dogs with more severe illness may benefit from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (to reduce fever and inflammation) and fluids (to treat dehydration).
Antibiotics are not usually necessary or recommended unless there are signs of bacterial pneumonia, including illness that lasts more than 10 days. In rare instances, dogs with severe disease may also need intensive supportive care, such as oxygen supplementation.
The best way to protect your dog against CIRDC is to keep his or her vaccines current. Vaccines not only reduce the chance of your dog becoming ill, they also make your dog less likely to develop severe disease or spread the infection to other dogs. This is why many facilities and events where dogs are routinely gathered, such as dog shows, training centers, and boarding facilities, require that dogs have certain vaccines.
Standard (or "core") canine vaccines are highly effective against some CIRDC-associated viruses and are recommended for all dogs. For optimal protection against common respiratory infections, an annual intranasal vaccine against Bordetella, canine adenovirus type 2, and canine parainfluenza is recommended for dogs of certain at-risk groups, including those whose lifestyles expose them to multiple-dog settings. Where canine influenza is known to be circulating, an injectable canine influenza vaccine also is recommended. Your veterinarian will help you decide which vaccines your dog needs to stay healthy as possible.
