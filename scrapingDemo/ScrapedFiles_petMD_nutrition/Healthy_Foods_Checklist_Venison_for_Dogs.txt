While venison, or deer meat, has less protein than beef, it also contains less fat and cholesterol, making it an increasingly popular meat source in commercial dog foods.
Venison is a good source of B vitamins and minerals such as zinc, phosphorous, and iron. It helps dogs maintain healthy energy levels and many dogs enjoy the taste.
Pet foods containing venison are a good option for dogs who may have food sensitivities or allergies to other protein sources such as beef or chicken. Since venison is a novel protein, it may help reduce allergens and skin irritations in pets with food-related issues.
You may find venison on a dog-food label listed as venison meal. Venison meal is a rendered meat concentrate that contains substantially more protein than fresh venison, making it a quality ingredient in commercial pet foods.
Venison can be included in homemade raw-food diets for dogs, but make sure to consult your veterinarian before switching your dog over to a raw-food meal plan.Â
