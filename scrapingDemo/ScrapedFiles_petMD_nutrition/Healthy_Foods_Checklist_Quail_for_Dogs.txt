In addition to turkey and chicken, pet food manufacturers are looking to alternative game birds for new recipes. Quail is popping up as an ingredient in several dog foods and provides ample benefits for our canine companions.
Quails are small ground-nesting game birds that are part of the pheasant family. Quail meat is a relatively lean, low-calorie protein option for dogs and acts as a natural source of essential vitamins. Quail is also high in phosphorous and iron, which helps support strong muscle development.
Adding quail or a quail-based food to your dog’s diet can offer variety and is a good way to change up the type of protein your dog is consuming on a regular basis. Quail is also a novel protein, making it a good solution for pets with food allergies or food sensitivities to proteins such as beef or chicken.
Quail meat and quail eggs can provide a wholesome option for pet parents who want to feed a raw-food diet to pets as well, but quail products may be difficult to find in supermarkets.
Make sure to consult a veterinarian before feeding your dog a raw food diet, or before picking a new commercial pet food.
