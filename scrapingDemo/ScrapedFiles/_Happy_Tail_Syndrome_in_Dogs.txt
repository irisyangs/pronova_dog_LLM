Happy tail syndrome is a condition where dogs cause damage to the tip of their tails from striking surfaces. Many times, this condition occurs when they are wagging their tail, which is why it’s coined happy tail syndrome.
This condition is anything but happy for dogs and pet parents. The tip of the dog’s tail becomes dried and cracked and starts bleeding because of the repetitive striking of the tail on surfaces.
Happy tail becomes painful for the dog and often frustrating for you to help treat, repair, and manage the condition. In the long term, this condition can lead to infection and nerve damage. In many cases, the tail must be amputated to prevent the dog from banging it on hard surfaces.
Usually, large breed dogs with powerful, skinny tails are prone to this condition. Vets often see this condition in Pit Bulls, Shepherds, Great Danes, and Greyhounds, but any breed can develop happy tail.
Many times, pet parents will notice a few drops of blood in their home and then search the dog for a wound. Some pet parents may notice hair loss and a cracked tail tip before it starts to bleed. Dogs otherwise behave normally, eating, drinking, urinating, and defecating as usual.
Happy tail can occur due to the following:
Excessive tail wagging and hitting hard surfaces around the home
Following a stay at a boarding facility or another tight space where they can easily bang their tail
Damage to the tail from fences, walls, doorways, and furniture
Most veterinarians can diagnose happy tail syndrome based on symptoms and breed. However, your vet may want to do some routine bloodwork to make sure there are no signs of anemia or low platelets, or do specialized testing for clotting. Your veterinarian may also recommend checking liver and kidney function, and longer-term use of anti-inflammatory medications.
Happy tail can be frustrating to treat medically, and many dogs do require surgery to amputate the tail to a length that they can no longer bang it into surfaces. Your veterinarian may try other therapies before recommending amputation.
They will apply a bandage to the tail to stop the bleeding and provide a layer of padding to the tail tip. The other main component to the healing process, and to hopefully prevent the need for amputation, is to stop the dog from vigorously wagging its tail. Sedative medications can allow time for the tail to heal. This could take a few weeks to a few months. It will take longer to heal if the dog continues to traumatize the tip of the tail.
Your vet will most likely prescribe a combination of pain medication, anti-inflammatories, and antibiotics. Some veterinarians may recommend adding Omega 3 fatty acids or applying topical vitamin A or E oil to prevent cracking.
They may also recommend the longer-term application of a specialized tail sling such as Happy Tail Saver. Some veterinarians and pet parents will try to use pool noodles and other repurposed items to provide padding. Because of the discomfort associated with happy tail and this bulky item attached to their tails, many dogs will want to chew off the items, which can lead to the bigger issue of a foreign body stuck in the intestines. The use of an e-collar can prevent the dog from getting the bandage off, continuing to lick or bite at the tail tip, and possibly eating the bandage.
One would think that dogs stop banging their tails once it starts to hurt; however, dogs use their tail as a part of their body language to convey emotions to other animals and people. All too often, these dogs require surgical amputation to shorten the length of the tail so that they cannot swing it with enough force to cause trauma.
In some cases, a dog may only have one incident of Happy Tail, especially if it occurred while in a tighter space such as a boarding facility or kennel situation. You may find that the tail heals after the first few bouts of happy tail, but this condition can become very frustrating if it reoccurs and ultimately ends with an amputation.  
How long it takes for the tail to heal each time depends on many factors, including prevention of further trauma. If the tip of the tail is not healing after a couple of weeks with sedatives and bandaging, then your veterinarian may want to recheck it.
Many times, owners become frustrated and elect tail amputation to prevent further trauma, pain, and possible infection. Surgery healing time is similar to that of a spay or neuter, and dogs do very well after a tail amputation. Even though the tail is an important part of their personality and showing emotions, they will still be their normal, happy selves without the bleeding and pain.
You can sometimes treat mild cases of happy tail at home. There are balm-type products that can help moisturize the tip of the tail to help prevent cracking and bleeding. Because there is minimal tissue on the tail, bandages can easily cut off circulation and cause harm, so it is best to leave bandaging to your veterinary staff.
Once the tip of the tail cracks open and starts bleeding, happy tail does hurt. Over time, this condition becomes more painful for the dog, and they can start to self-mutilate the tip of their tail or increase the potential for infection by licking.
Happy tail is a painful condition that needs pain medication and sedatives to stop the process and allow the tip of the tail to heal. If the tail does not heal, many times veterinarians and pet parents choose tail amputation to prevent further trauma.
