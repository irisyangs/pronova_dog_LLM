Estrogen -- a type of hormone -- is naturally produced in female dogs. It is responsible for normal sexual behavior and development, and the customary biological function of the female reproductive tract. Overproduction of estrogen can result in what is known as estrogen toxicity (hyperestrogenism). This can happen without any outside interference or it can occur when estrogens are being introduced artificially.
Estrogens sometimes cause abnormal (cystic) cells to line the uterus and this permits the invasion of bacteria from the vagina. The cervix is open during "heat," but if it is closed it can lead to a serious infection (pyometra). In addition, a concentration of estrogen can result in infertility, as well as an imbalance in the blood.

Recovery may take a while -- up to several months -- so be prepared to provide long-term care for your pet. Be vigilant in providing prescribed medications and aware of any changes in your pet. Blood tests (and sometimes bone-marrow biopsies) must be performed to evaluate your pet's response to the therapy.
Do not give estrogen-containing compounds unless advised to by your veterinarian. Females will undergo tests to determine whether ovulation is occurring.
In addition, a male dog should not show signs of feminization once a testicular tumor has been removed.
