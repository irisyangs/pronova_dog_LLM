Amebiasis is a parasitic infection caused by a one celled organism known as an ameba. Amebiasis can affect people as well as dogs and cats. It is found most often in tropical areas and can be seen in North America.
There are two types of parasitic ameba that infect dogs: Entamoeba histolytica and Acanthamoeba.

Entamoeba histolyticus is most often spread through the ingestion of infected human feces. There are two species of Acanthamoeba that are free-living: A. castellani and A. culbertsoni. These species can be found in freshwater, saltwater, soil and sewage.
