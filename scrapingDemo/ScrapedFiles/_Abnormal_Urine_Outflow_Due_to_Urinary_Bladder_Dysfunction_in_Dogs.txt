Vesicourachal diverticula is congenital condition in which the urachus -- embryological canal or tube connecting the placenta with urinary bladder of fetus -- fails to close. This impairs the animal's normal urine outflow and makes it susceptible to urinary tract infections. If not treated properly, the condition may persist indefinitely.
Often, vesicouracahal deiverticula occurs in the womb or during the birthing process. However, there is also an acquired form of the condition, which results from diseases that put undue pressure on the bladder (e.g., bacterial urinary tract infections, uroliths, and urethral plugs). There is no breed or age predisposition for vesicouracahal deiverticula.
You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which help identify the underlying cause of the condition and the present of concurrent disorders.
The best tool for confirming diagnosis, however, is X-rays of the urethra and bladder while using contrast medium.

The course of treatment will ultimately depend on the underlying cause of vesicourachal diverticula. Dogs that do not respond to conventional treatment may require surgery to correct the defect.
You will need to visit the veterinarian for regular follow-up exams, where he or she will take urine samples to evaluate the status of infection. Some animals will require long-term antibiotic therapy to combat urinary tract infections. However, overall prognosis in dogs with vesicourachal diverticula is good after treatment.
