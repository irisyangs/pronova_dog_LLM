Tyzzer disease is a bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Clostridium pilformis. The bacterium is thought to multiply in the intestines and once reaching the liver, causing severe damage. Young dogs are at high risk of developing the disease.
Due to the severity of the liver damage, some dogs with Tyzzer disease may die within 24-48 hours. Some early signs of the disease include:
The bacterium Clostridium piliformis.
Your veterinarian will conduct a complete medical history and perform a physical examination on your dog. He or she will then use routine laboratory tests including complete blood count, biochemistry profile, electrolyte panel, and urinalysis to assess the condition of your dog and severity of the disease.
If your dog has Tyzzer disease, the biochemistry profile testing may reveal abnormally high levels of liver enzymes, especially shortly before the dog's condition becomes dire.

Unfortunately, there is currently no effective treatment for Tyzzer disease. Consult with your veterinarian if there is anything that can be done to alleviate your dog's pain.
