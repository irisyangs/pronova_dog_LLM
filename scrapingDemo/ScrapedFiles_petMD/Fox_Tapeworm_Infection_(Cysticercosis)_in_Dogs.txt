Cysticercosis is a rare disease caused by the larvae Taenia crassiceps, a type of tapeworm. Once the eggs (which is suspected to be found in the feces of infected foxes) are ingested by rabbits or other rodents, it develops in the abdominal and subcutaneous tissues, and eventually forms large masses of cysticerci (larval form) in the abdominal cavity, lungs, muscles, and in the tissues under the skin. Even worse, the cysticercus is capable of undergoing asexual reproduction and multiplying a high rate.
It is rarely reported in Europe or the United States, but often occurs in olders dogs or young immuno-compromised pups.
Cysticerci masses may found under the skin or in other organs, causing several complications including:
Mode of infection not clear, but three are hypothesized:
  
You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and electrolyte panel. X-rays will help to determine the degree of spread to the internal organs, and an ultrasound will differentiate these masses from cancers, which are solid.

Surgery is necessary to remove the larval masses. However, depending on how severe the secondary symptoms are, your veterinarian may need to stabilize and hospitalize the animal first.
Fortunately, the stages in which dogs display clinical signs are not zoonotic, so owners should not fear of contracting the worms from his or her dog. However, your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments to examine the dog and monitor (often with abdominal ultrasounds) for the potential spread of lesions and the development of new lesions in different sites.
