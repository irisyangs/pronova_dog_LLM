       "Cytopoint® is an injectable medication specifically designed for dogs to alleviate itching associated with atopic dermatitis, which is commonly caused by environmental allergies. The active ingredient in Cytopoint® is lokivetmab, a dog-specific monoclonal antibody that targets and neutralizes interleukin-31 (IL-31), a protein that plays a significant role in the itch response.\n",

       "Here are some key points about Cytopoint®:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Administration**: It is administered as an injection under your dog’s skin by a veterinarian.\n",
       "- **Duration of Effect**: After the injection, you can expect a gradual decrease in your dog's itchiness over the course of 4 to 8 weeks.\n",
       "- **Follow-Up**: It is essential to have follow-up consultations with your veterinarian to assess the effectiveness of the treatment and determine the appropriate frequency for future injections.\n",
       "- **Combination with Other Treatments**: Cytopoint® is often used alongside other allergy management treatments to help improve the overall health of your dog’s skin.\n",
       "- **Not a Cure**: While it significantly reduces itching, Cytopoint® does not cure the underlying allergic condition; it is a symptomatic treatment aimed at providing relief.\n",
       "\n",
       "If you have more specific questions about its use or effects on your dog, it's best to consult with your veterinarian."
